        Exercise is linked to increased muscle strength, improved heart health, lower blood sugar and numerous other health benefits. 
        <br> <br> Activities such as running on a treadmill, biking up a steep hill, lifting weights or taking a brisk lunchtime walk offer a wide range of advantages that go beyond enhancing physical appearance or stamina.

    <p>
        Evidence from studies suggests that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/153390">regular physical activity</a> could boost mood, alleviate stress, and sharpen cognitive function, underscoring the deep connection between body and mind.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, different people can respond quite differently to various forms of exercise, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/327100">aerobic workouts</a> or strength training.

            <li>How exercise affects the body at the molecular level
                <ul>
                    <li>In a new collaborative effort led by Stanford Medicine, researchers have explored the underlying mechanisms through which exercise promotes overall health, particularly brain health.</li>
                    <li>By understanding how exercise affects different organs at the molecular level, health care providers could tailor exercise recommendations more effectively.</li>

            <li>How endurance training affects the body
                <ul>
                    <li>The Nature study examined the effects of 8 weeks of endurance training on various biological systems, including gene expression (the transcriptome), proteins (the proteome), fats (the lipidome), metabolites (the metabolome), DNA chemical tags (the epigenome) and the immune system.</li>
                    <li>The researchers conducted analyses on different tissues in rats trained to run increasing distances and compared these with the tissues of sedentary rats.</li>

            <li>Does biological sex affect how we respond to exercise?
                <ul>
                    <li>Finally, the researchers identified sex differences in how male and female ratsâ€™ tissues responded to exercise.</li>
                    <li>After 8 weeks, male rats lost about 5% of their body fat, while female rats did not lose a significant amount. However, the female rats maintained their initial fat percentage, whereas sedentary females gained an additional 4% body fat during the study.</li>
